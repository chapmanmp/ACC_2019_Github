% DESCRIPTION: Computes the parameters for linear matrix inequalities 
% INPUT: 
    % x : state at time k, real number
    % u : control at time k, real number
    % ws(i) : ith realization of disturbance, real number
    % xs : x values, row vector
    % ls : confidence levels, row vector
    % J_k+1 : optimal cost-to-go at time k+1, array
    % dt : duration of [k,k+1) interval
    % area_pond : approx. surface area of pond
% OUTPUT: 
    % As{i} & bs{i} are column vectors that encode the linear interpolation of y*J_k+1( x_k+1, y ) vs. y, at the ith realization of x_k+1
    % ith realization of x_k+1 = pond_dynamics_dt( x, u, ws(i), dt, area_pond )
% NOTE:
    % max_t,y { t | As{1}(i)*y + bs{1}(i) >= t } is equivalent to max_y { g(y) := min_i As{1}(i)*y + bs{1}(i) }                                          
    % g(y) = linear interpolation of y*J_k+1(x,y) vs. y, at fixed x; concave & piecewise linear in y
    % uses Chow, et al. NIPS 2015 to manage continuous confidence level
    % uses linear interpolation to manage continuous state space
