beta = 10^(-3);                  % scale down so LP CVX solver works for large m

gx = x - 5; % one-sided signed distance since we only care about overflowing and x will never be <0

m = 10;                                 % soft-max parameter

nt = 100000;                                                        % number of trials per grid point

~N(0, small_sd = 10^(-7)), add small Gaussian noise
