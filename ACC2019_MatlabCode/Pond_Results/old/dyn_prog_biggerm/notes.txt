Running Main_DynProgram_Pond.m

getProbDist.m : sdpt3 solver

maxExp_pond.m : mosek solver

m = 15;                                 % soft-max parameter

beta = 10^(-6);                  % scale down so LP CVX solver works for large m

gx = x - 5; % one-sided signed distance since we only care about overflowing and x will never be <0
