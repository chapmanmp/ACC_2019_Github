Running Main_DynProgram_Pond.m


beta = 10^(-3);                  % scale down so LP CVX solver works for large m

m = 10;                          % soft-max parameter

in getProbDist.m: cvx_solver sdpt3 (so P is the same as before)

in maxExp_pond.m: default solver is mosek

gx = x - 5; % one-sided signed distance since we only care about overflowing and x will never be <0
